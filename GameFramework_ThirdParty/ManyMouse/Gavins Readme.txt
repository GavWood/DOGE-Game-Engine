This static library uses ManyMouse from Ryan C. Gordon <icculus@icculus.org>.

--ryan.



This enables the GameFramework to simulate many mouse touches in Windows without needing a touch sensitive screen. The game wrapper is written in gamemouse.cpp and uses Ryan's source code to create a state array used by 
the game.
